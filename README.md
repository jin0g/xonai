# xonai - Xonsh Shell on AI Integrations

xonai seamlessly integrates AI assistants into your xonsh shell, transforming natural language into shell commands and answers. Currently supports Claude AI with a modular architecture for future AI models.

## Prerequisites

### AI Agent Setup
xonai requires an AI agent to function. Currently supported:

- **Claude Code** (Primary): [Installation Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started)

**Note**: While xonai is designed with a modular architecture to support multiple AI models in the future, Claude Code is currently the only supported AI agent.
